## Overview

The Advice Generator App displays a piece of advice along with its ID.
When the user clicks the dice button, a new advice is fetched and displayed instantly without refreshing the page.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

 Built with
* HTML5 – for structuring the content
* CSS3 – for styling and layout
* JavaScript (ES6) – for functionality and API interaction
* Advice Slip API – for generating random advice

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned:

* How to fetch data from an external API
* How to update HTML content dynamically using JavaScript
* How to structure a simple project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* How to handle errors when working with APIs


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to:
-Improve my understanding of asynchronous JavaScript.
-Practice writing cleaner and more reusable code.
-Add loading states and animations for better user experience.
-Explore using APIs in more complex applications.
